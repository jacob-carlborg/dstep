# DStep Change Log

## Unreleased
### New/Changed Features

* Support for simple defines (like `#define FOO 1`)
* Translation of defines to functions (like `#define FOO(a, b) a + b`)
* Support for preprocessor token-pasting operator (##)
* Support for translation of whole packages (`--package` CLI option)
* Support for translation of preprocessor constants in array sizes
* Support for global comments and comments inside structs and enums
* Detecting collisions of renamed tag-space names (struct name_t ...) with existing ones
* Special treatment of a comment before header guard
* Support for removing excessive newlines and keeping original spacing
* Basic unit tests were added
* Cucumber tests were replaced with D-based tests
* Statements are now translated in the original order as the input file
* Multiple input files can be processed at once
* Extend a functionality that automatically replaces aliases to basic types with their D equivalents
* Add a switch `--dont-reduce-aliases` which disables the above functionality
* Add a switch `--alias-enum-members` which enables generation of aliases for enum members in the global scope
* Add a switch `--translate-macros` which can disable the translation of C macro definitions
* Add the `libclang` bindings as a test case
* Add support for Microsoft Windows
* Run Windows tests on AppVeyor
* Handle complex floating-point types.
* Use the new alias syntax (`alias Y = X`) in the output
* Support for custom global attributes (e.g. `nothrow`, `@nogc`)
* Add support for building with LDC
* Bump the minimum requirement D compilers to their latest version
* Always test using the latest version of DMD and LDC, including beta and nightly builds
* Bump the minimum requirement of libclang to 3.9.0
* Automatically generate the libclang bindings using DStep
* Add a switch `--rename-enum-members`, which enables stripping of superfluous prefixes from enum members.
* Add a switch `--normalize-modules`, which enables changing the names of modules to the D conforming form.
* Add support for bit fields.
